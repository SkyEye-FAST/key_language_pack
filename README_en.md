# Minecraft Translation Key Language Resource Pack

- **[English](/README_en.md) | [ä¸­æ–‡](/README.md)**

----

This project provides a resource pack replacing the content of Minecraft: Java Edition language files with translation keys.

It is recommended to use this resource pack with the mods [Language Reload](https://modrinth.com/mod/language-reload) and [Untranslated Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/untranslated-items).

## Description

### Obtaining Language Files

This repository automatically checks for updates to Minecraft: Java Edition language file (`en_us.json`) every day at ðŸ•§00:30 (UTC+8, equivalent to ðŸ•ŸUTC 16:30) and updates the resource pack accordingly. This is done using the script [`source.py`](/source.py) (requires `requests`). The obtained language files are stored in the `source` folder, which is at the same level as the script.

### Resource Pack

**Note: This project ignores all translation keys starting with `translation.` because they are used to test whether in-game strings can be displayed correctly. Additionally, they are too complex and are not likely to occur in regular strings. For resource packs that replace these keys, refer to [Nickid2018/TranslationKeyPack](https://github.com/Nickid2018/TranslationKeyPack) and [bilintsui/keypack](https://github.com/bilintsui/keypack).**

The resource pack is generated using [`pack.py`](/pack.py). The language files generated by the script are [`key.json`](/key.json) and [`key_arg.json`](/key_arg.json), which are packed together with [`pack.mcmeta`](/pack.mcmeta) into [`key_language_pack.zip`](/key_language_pack.zip).

The resource pack adds a language called "Translation (Keys)" to the game. Upon selection, all strings will be replaced with translation keys.

Additionally, the resource pack provides a language named "Translation (Keys with Arguments)", similar to MediaWiki's `qqx` language. Upon selection, strings will be replaced with translation keys and original arguments will be enclosed in parentheses.

The effect of selecting "Translation (Keys)" is shown in the images below:
